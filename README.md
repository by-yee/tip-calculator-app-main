## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I'm currently learning react and this was my first project that I code with react instead of pure javascript.

Rather than using `Create React App` to build react environment, I tried to set up react environment manually by running fews npm command and modify the `webpack.config.js` & `.babelrc`, so that I have more understanding on what react actually used to performed development.

Since this project was using react, it's my first time to publish github page by installing github page dependency(run `npm i gh-pages`). After installing, update homepage from `package.json` to own github repository link, then run `npm run deploy`. This will compiled, build the public files and publish github page.


### Continued development

In this project, I am importing the `.css` file directly into `App.js`. For the future development, I would like to use react style component.

As a beginner of using react, I'm using `this.state` & `this.setState` to change the state object. Once familiar to react, I would like to try on using Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc...
